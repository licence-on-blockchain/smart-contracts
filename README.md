# License on Blockchain – Smart Contracts

The Smart Contracts that back the [License on Blockchain](https://github.com/license-on-blockchain) framework. 

Please refer to the [whitepaper](https://github.com/licence-on-blockchain/whitepaper) for an overview of the smart contracts and how they interact with each other.

## Testing

LOB uses [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) with the [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) ethereum client to test its smart contracts. Please refer to their [documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/getting_started/installation) on how to set up the test environment.
